# KU Alchemists: The Academic Concoction by fullmetal alchemists

This game has been developed by the Fullmetal Alchemists team, as the final project for the Software Engineering course (COMP302). Our primary goal for this project was to apply and demonstrate our understanding of design patterns, adhere to the MVVM design principles, and familiarize ourselves with Agile Development methodologies.

## About

KU Alchemists: The Academic Concoction immerses players in the fascinating world of alchemy, where they compete to become the most renowned potion maker in the Alchemical University. The game is designed to not only put into practice the skills we've learned throughout our course but to also offer an enjoyable experience that we, as its creators, would love to engage with.
